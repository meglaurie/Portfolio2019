        <p style="display:none;">Megan Laurie is a Frontend Developer and UX/UI designer, with 2 years of experience, based in Calgary AB, Canada. Megan’s main programming language is Javascript, but she is currently learning C#.

    She completed a diploma in Web Development from the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology in the spring of 2017. She graduated with honours (4.0 GPA) and is member of SAIT’s Honour Society. She completed a prestigious software development internship at Critical Mass in the summer 2017. Then she went on to start her own freelance business where she completed work for various projects in Alberta and British Columbia and on to work for a local IOT startup called Nu-worx Innovations. She is currently working as a Digital Designer for ITN International in Calgary AB.

    Megan graduated with a BA in anthropology from Mount Royal University in 2015 and uses her social science background for UX research. After graduating in 2015, she worked as a photographer and editor for Humans Of Calgary (a social media art project) and volunteered as web moderator for CJSW radio station. She has returned to SAIT as a guest speaker for their Fast Track Web Development program to encourage others to verb the adjective noun.
